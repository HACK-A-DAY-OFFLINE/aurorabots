Hybrid Leg-Wheel Robot with 2D Mapping & Vision
A multi-terrain robotic platform combining wheeled drive + leg modulation, equipped with ultrasonic sensors for 2D environmental mapping and a camera module for live visual feedback.
This project aims to explore adaptive robotic mobility and low-cost local mapping using embedded systems and Python.
